Notice
------------
The XDL Parser is free software.  See the files whose names start with COPYING
for copying permission.  The manuals, and some of the runtime libraries, are
under different terms; see the individual source files for details.

Description
------------
This project aims to provide a java platform for working with Xilinx XDL files.
The program parses XDL files and currently presents some statistics on the
wires, wire segments, pips, etc. The grammar is not complete in some parts
(additional reverse engineering is required) and help is welcome!

Requirements
------------
* gcj >= 4.5   (maybe older also okay?)
* javac >= 1.5 (maybe older also okay?)
* jar
